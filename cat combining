You can try cat.

Code:
cat movie1.avi movie2.avi > movie_new.avi
Then you have to use mencoder to rebuild the index or else you will end up with garbage.
Code:
mencoder -forceidx -oac copy -ovc copy movie_new.avi -o movie.avi
For mpg, might work for avi too
Code:
mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy movie1 movie2 -o movie.mpg
